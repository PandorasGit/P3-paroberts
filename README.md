### Reflection
I hate 3D so much. It added to much complexity for the project for me to understand fully. I spent hours trying to understand how to get a Vector3 to rotate. I am still not confident in it. 3D assets are also a much greater pain to deal with. This game feels worse than the final version of project one. I am not proud of this game dispite meeting all the requirements. I will do all I can to convince my group that 2D will make for a much better final project.

### Self-Assessment

- [X] D-1: The repository link is submitted before the project deadline.
- [X] C-1: The tutorial has been completed.
- [X] B-1: Your repository is well-formed, in our course organization, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file, no unnecessary files tracked, and all commit messages following <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/">our commit message style guide</a>.
- [X] B-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] B-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file, and you have satisfied all license requirements.
- [X] B-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game.
- [X] B-5: The project report is complete.
- [X] B-6: The player can fire a projectile, controlling its angle and power.
- [X] B-7: There are one or more targets whose hitting is meaningful to the gameplay (e.g. points are earned, the player wins).

- [X] B-9: The game runs without errors or warnings.
- [X] A-1: The player experiences a complete loop: a menu or introduction; goal-directed gameplay; an ending.
